# MinPatch for R

**Note: This is still a work in progress and significant bugs may be
present. Use with caution**

More information on the original implemention of MinPatch for Marxan and
QGIS is available here:
<https://cluz-systematic-conservation-planning.github.io>

## Overview

An R implementation of the MinPatch algorithm for post-processing
conservation planning solutions to ensure minimum protected area sizes.

MinPatch is a post-processing tool for conservation planning solutions
that ensures all protected areas meet user-defined minimum size
thresholds. This R package implements the methodology described in Smith
et al. (2010) and is designed to work with solutions from the
`prioritizr` package, though it can work with any binary conservation
solution.

### The Problem

Conservation planning software like Marxan and prioritizr can produce
solutions with many small, fragmented protected areas. While these
solutions may be mathematically optimal, small protected areas are
often:

- Less ecologically viable
- More expensive to manage
- More vulnerable to edge effects
- Less resilient to disturbances

### The Solution

MinPatch addresses this by post-processing conservation solutions
through three stages:

1.  **Remove Small Patches**: Eliminate protected areas smaller than a
    minimum size threshold
2.  **Add New Patches**: Add new areas to meet conservation targets
    using the BestPatch algorithm
3.  **Simulated Whittling**: Remove unnecessary planning units while
    maintaining constraints

## Installation

``` r

# Install from GitHub
pak::pak("SpatialPlanning/minpatch")
```

## Key Features

- **Full MinPatch Algorithm**: Complete implementation of all three
  stages
- **prioritizr Integration**: Seamless workflow with prioritizr
  solutions
- **Locked Constraints Support**: Automatically respects locked-in and
  locked-out constraints from prioritizr
- **Flexible Parameters**: Control minimum patch sizes, patch radius,
  and boundary penalties
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed statistics and comparisons
- **Visualization Support**: Plot results with ggplot2 (optional)

## Algorithm Details

### Locked Constraints

MinPatch automatically respects locked-in and locked-out constraints
from prioritizr problems:

- **Locked-in constraints** (from `add_locked_in_constraints()`):
  Planning units that are locked-in will never be removed, regardless of
  patch size or during the whittling stage. These units are treated as
  “conserved” areas that must be retained in the final solution.

- **Locked-out constraints** (from `add_locked_out_constraints()`):
  Planning units that are locked-out will never be selected, even when
  adding new patches to meet conservation targets. These units are
  completely excluded from consideration.

If locked-in units form patches smaller than `min_patch_size`, a warning
will be issued, but these units will still be preserved in the solution.

### Stage 1: Remove Small Patches

Identifies connected components (patches) in the solution and removes
those smaller than the minimum size threshold. Locked-in planning units
are never removed, even if they form small patches.

### Stage 2: Add New Patches (BestPatch Algorithm)

Uses the BestPatch scoring system to add new patches:

1.  Calculate current conservation levels for each feature
2.  Identify features with unmet targets
3.  Score potential patches based on their contribution to targets
    relative to cost
4.  Add the highest-scoring patch and repeat

The BestPatch score is calculated as:

``` R
Score = Σ(feature_contribution / target_gap) / patch_cost
```

### Stage 3: Simulated Whittling

Removes unnecessary planning units through an iterative process:

1.  Identify edge units (on the boundary of selected areas)
2.  Calculate whittling scores based on feature importance
3.  Remove units that don’t violate constraints:
    - Must not cause targets to be unmet
    - Must not make patches too small
    - Must not increase total cost (if boundary penalty \> 0)
    - Must not split patches into non-viable pieces
