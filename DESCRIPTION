Description: Implements the MinPatch algorithm for post-processing conservation planning 
    solutions from prioritizr to ensure all protected areas meet user-defined minimum 
    size thresholds. Based on the methodology described in Smith et al. (2010) 
    "An approach for ensuring minimum protected area size in systematic conservation planning".
    The package provides functions to remove small patches, add new patches to meet 
    conservation targets, and remove unnecessary planning units while maintaining 
    minimum patch sizes and conservation objectives.
