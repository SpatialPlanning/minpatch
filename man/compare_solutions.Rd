\arguments{
\item{minpatch_result}{Result from run_minpatch function}
}
\value{
List containing:
  \itemize{
    \item overall: Data frame with overall solution comparison
    \item features: Data frame with feature-level area comparisons

Creates a comprehensive comparison of key metrics between original and MinPatch solutions,
including overall statistics and detailed feature-level analysis
